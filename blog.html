      <h2>About CSM Scott Bailey</h2>
      <p class="blog_p">
        Command Sergeant Major Scott Allen Bailey was a highly decorated soldier
        who tragically lost his life on November 4, 2017. He proudly served 30
        years on active duty in the United States Army. He was laid to rest at
        Arlington National Cemetery on Feb 13, 2018, just days after he was
        scheduled to retire.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_p">
        CSM Bailey dedicated his entire career to helping his soldiers. His door
        was always open to anybody who needed help regardless if it was a
        military or personal problem. He was an exceptional leader that actively
        engaged with his soldiers to check on their mental health and morale.
        Even when soldiers were no longer his responsibility, he would reach out
        and offer a helping hand. He was an amazing soldier, leader, mentor and
        father.
      </p>
      <p class="blog_p">
        CSM Bailey was an inspiration to everybody he met. He was honest about
        his time before the military and how he decided to join the Army at the
        age of 25. He went from being a high school drop out to a command
        sergeant major in the Army. In addition to his many military
        achievements, he earned his bachelor’s degree in 2014 from Franklin
        University.
